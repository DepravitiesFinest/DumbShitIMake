# Welcome To My Dump
This repository will be a collection of the random projects I build don’t expect anything too polished here! I aim to make some tools and projects that might be useful to others when I get around to creating and finishing them. Everything shared here is completely open-source, but I want to give a heads-up: many of these projects will be simplified versions of what I plan to sell in the future. As a result, they will have fewer features and might not be as user-friendly and won't look even close to the paid product-(at least most of them).

If you decide to use, modify, or expand upon any of my projects, I just ask for a few things:

Give credit: Please acknowledge my work if you use or build upon it. No skidding—credit where credit is due.

Non-commercial use: Feel free to make changes or share with friends, but I ask that you don’t sell any derivatives without permission.
